Summary:

Wearable or infrastructure sensors have been widely proposed for automated tracking and analysis of individual-level exercise activities. This dataset is collected as part of building a pervasive, low-cost digital personal trainer system, that supports fine-grained tracking of an individual’s free-weights exercises via a combination of (a) sensors on personal wireless ear-worn devices (‘earables’) and (b) inexpensive IoT sensors attached to exercise equipment (e.g., dumbbells). This sample dataset is comprised of sensor signals acquired from two 6-axis IMUs and contains a total of 324 samples for 3 different free-weight exercises performed by 27 individuals.
